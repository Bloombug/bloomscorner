I could be feeling a lot more sad.

I am writing this on the 12th of February, on a cold Saturday night. I usually find myself unable to express my thoughts in a creative way, hence why this post is taking double, even triple the time to write compared to the other 2 i have written so far (not a bad achievement, considering i tend to destroy whatever i create in a period of 24 to 48 hours. Good on me, i suppose), but I felt like writing something actually readable today. I am not sure why, but i just felt like it. Whenever i was feeling down, or just not feeling like functioning like a human being, i would lean into books, music, and my own writing. Mostly poems, some adventure texts here and there, but nothing too fancy usually. I would always look forward for the exams back in high school, as those had a "write a text about" exercise that would account for 5, sometimes 10 points on your final score. It would give me a random subject to write about, and it would tell me the word (or lines) limits my text could have. And nothing else.I never bothered with those limits. My teacher didn't mind either, as I always has the tendency to write the most heartwarming text i could, even with a text on death, so my teacher would relax a bit after having to correct and evaluate "creative" compositions with 2 paragraphs, or without a single comma on sight.

To be honest, i never thought what i wrote was any good until my teacher would read it out loud, in front of an entire class that would hate me for a week for that single moment of pride. She would even repeat her favourite lines, and analyze them in a academic way. It was a weird way of showing that she liked my work, but every time i was handed out a test, that single exercise was the thing i would focus on, the only thing that would require me to actually focus on, just to continue to amaze my teacher.

When i was finishing my technical course, right after high school, one of my assignments was to analyze a website of our choosing using an accessibility tool, write a report on any flaws the website had, and how would you fixed them to conform to WCAG's accessibility guidelines. As a lame yet anarchy-filled joke, i chose a popular technology website that had a habit of replying to comments from disgruntled users the same way your middle school friends would reply if you handed them a rotten sandwich for lunch. It was one of the two subjects I ever passed with the maximum grade, with my teacher congratulating me for the clever choice of website to target for the assignment, and the simple yet efficient way I handled most of the (quite) extensive flaws and errors it had at the time. I felt like the little kid who wrote a good text about mirrors and dragons again.

Years have passed since the last time any of my work was even analyzed, less praised, since i have not put much effort into feeding my writer's crave for almost 6 years now. Perhaps a few years later i may realise i was taking a creative break, or that i was not being challenged into creating good content, or that i was just, pardon my French, lazy as fuck. Either way, until i started writing this blog, a few weeks ago, i had nowhere i could dump all my frustrations or ideas into, until now. So I felt like it was a good idea to, instead of complaining about the loneliness and sadness i usually feel around this time, that i would complain about a flaw of my own. I should write more, and i will write more. What i needed as a digital notepad, a way to engrave my own thoughts into something i could access anytime, anywhere, without having to remember if i brought a pen with me, or not. I always bring one with me, you never know.

I didn't feel too well this week, as i have (supposedly) suffored a small case of food poisoning. Perhaps eating half a jar of apple sauce every 2 days is not a good way to maintain your stomach healthy, but that's the way you learn: when you realize it is a bad idea when you are throwing out everything you ate since Monday. Dully noted.

I could be feeling a bit more sad. I could also be feeling a lot happier, but that would mean i was capable of storing and processing tremendous ammounts of happiness, which is not the case.
