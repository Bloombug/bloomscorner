So, here we are. After years of putting together sketchy Django servers, studying JS frameworks and considering using (gasp) Adobe Dreamweaver just to tell myself i can do something other than solve FizzBuzz exercises, i was finally able to set up a web development server AND deploy it on an actual website!!!

Granted, i am using Netlify which makes things 100x easier compared to manually import files, configure routers and paths, and hope i made sure i imported every single dependency, but the effort is there: Hugo server (which runs on Go, which is quite awesome), a small but neat and efficient theme and a free Netlify account was all i needed to put this show on the road!

I am quite grateful that a) i can use Markdown to write posts (like this one!), b) i can also use HTML, CSS and JS for everything else, and c) Hugo pretty much takes everything and automagically creates a neat website, assuming you also chose a comprehensive theme that offered you a simple way to edit routers, layouts and assets...

Either way, i am excited to finally get to update and manage my own blog, no matter how messed up my code may be...
