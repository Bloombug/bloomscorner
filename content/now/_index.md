For people that need to know what the heck i am doing at the moment!

## Work

Currently trying to get myself an internship, maybe even an entry level job to improve my XP skills; also trying to get myself some Python and Go skills (looking at Rust for a backup plan :D ).

## Relationship

Nope.

## Personality

I have one as well, yes.

## Books

*The Hunt for Red October*, *Betrayal* (About the *Boston Globe*'s work on child abuse involving the Catholic Church) and *The Hungover Cookbook*.

## Social Media

My social activity is around [github](https://github.com/Bloombug), reddit and youtube.

## Coding activity

Mostly focusing on Go and Python right now, but always interested on developing my Java and WebDev skills.
